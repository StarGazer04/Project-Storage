- code was compiled using javac FractalDrawer.java and then java FractalDrawer
- only additional feature implemented was the creation of the array list. this use of the array was not mentioned from the reading, but ive known a bit of java before class and i prefer creating it the way it was used in my FractalDrawer class.
- no known bugs
- outside sources: https://coderanch.com/t/336174/java/changing-colors-statement 
    this source was used to implement a new color shape for every recursion. no code was copied from this website to my project. 
    this website was only used as a way to check how I would go about checking if a Color object was equal to a parameter value.
